This mod can also be found on [Mod Workshop](https://modworkshop.net/mod/26920).

## Overview

Demo: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0FaiAFPhd4E

Key features and options:

- **Hide Duplicate Skins:** Duplicate copies of skins will be hidden from the weapon customization menu. They will still be visible in the Steam Inventory menu.
- **Automatically Use Visible Skin:** If your currently equipped skin is hidden, the mod will automatically switch to the visible version of the skin.
- **Offline Support:** Duplicate hiding works in offline mode as well, but you will need to install Improved Offline Functionality to prevent your skins from disappearing.

The following modes can be chosen to determine how skins are prioritized when hiding duplicates:

- **Prefer Stat Boost:** The best stat boosted skin will be shown. If no stat boosted skins are available, the best normal version will be shown.
- **Prefer Quality:** The skin with the best wear will be shown. If there is a stat boosted skin with the best wear, it will be preferred over a normal version with the same wear.
- **Best Normal & Stat:** Both the best normal and stat boosted version of the skin will be shown (if available).
- **All Variants:** Every unique combination of stat boost and wear will be shown, i.e. Mint-Condition, Mint-Condition Stat Boost, Lightly-Marked, Lightly-Marked Stat Boost, etc.

## Compatibility
