# Suppressed Raven Admiral Barrel

Latest version [v1.1](https://github.com/fragtrane/Payday-2-Mods/raw/master/Suppressed%20Raven%20Admiral%20Barrel/Suppressed_Raven_Admiral_Barrel_v1.1.zip).

This mod can also be found on [Mod Workshop](https://modworkshop.net/mod/26914).

## Overview

Demo: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AyhWtQ63WyQ

This mod turns the Raven Admiral's legendary barrel into a silencer. It does not let you use the barrel without owning the skin. It also does not give any stats that are not possible in the base game.

Key features and options:

- **Silencer Effect for Raven's Legendary Barrel:** The Raven's legendary barrel now has a silencer effect, allowing you to use it in stealth without slapping a suppressor on it and making the gun ridiculously long and ugly. As with all silencers, Dragon's Breath rounds are not allowed.
- **Balanced Stats:** The stats of the legendary barrel are equal to the combined effects of the Short Barrel and The Silent Killer Suppressor. By happy accident, the Optical Illusions aced bug will even give you +3 concealment which is exactly what you would get if you were using The Silent Killer Suppressor. So stats-wise, it is completely identical to a vanilla stealth Raven.
- **OSA/SDSS Integration:** Both [Optional Skin Attachments](https://github.com/fragtrane/Payday-2-Mods/tree/master/Optional%20Skin%20Attachments) and [Super Duper Skin Swapper](https://github.com/fragtrane/Payday-2-Mods/tree/master/Super%20Duper%20Skin%20Swapper) have the option to display legendary weapon mods in the weapon modification menu. If you are using the Suppressed Raven Admiral Barrel mod, the name of the legendary barrel will be changed to "Admiral Suppressed Barrel".

## IMPORTANT: Client Detection Risk

The mod works as both host and client. However, if you are a client, the host will see you with the wrong detection risk which can cause problems in stealth if you are not aware, because the host calculates the detection. This happens because you have modified the stats of your attachments, but other players can only see the original stats. TL;DR:

- Real Admiral Barrel: other players see your concealment DECREASED by 2 points, i.e. HIGHER detection risk (bad).
- Add-On Admiral Barrel (AOLA): other players will see your concealment INCREASED by 2 points, i.e. LOWER detection risk (good).

The real Admiral Barrel only decreases your concealment by 2 points so this should not be a big issue. The Add-On Admiral Barrel is safe to use as a client.

Note: if the host has also installed the mod, then the real legendary attachments will have their stats calculated correctly by the host and can be safely used. The add-on legendary attachments will still have the wrong stats because they are synced as different parts.

## Host/Client Interactions

This mod has been tested both as client and host with vanilla and modded peers.

- The silencer effect works both as client and host. Guards will not be alerted, so you can safely use it in stealth.
- The gunshot sound is only suppressed for players who have the mod. Any gunshot from a Raven Admiral Barrel will sound suppressed to a modded player. So if an unmodded player in your lobby is using a Raven Admiral, their gunshots will sound suppressed for you while they are in fact loud (and will alert guards).
- Players who do not have the mod will hear a loud gunshot. This may be confusing for them because they will hear a loud gunshot but won't see guards being alerted.
- Similarly, you will see a silencer icon in the loadout screen next to any player with a Raven Admiral Barrel equipped, regardless of whether or not they have the mod.
- Unmodded players will not see a silencer icon in the loadout screen.
